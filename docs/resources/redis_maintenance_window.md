  Provides a resource to manage a maintenance window of a redis instance
---

# herokux\_redis\_maintenance\_window

This resource manages the [maintenance window](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis-maintenance)
for a Heroku redis instance.

Maintenance windows are 4 hours long starting at the time you specify. The actual time required for maintenance
depends on exactly what’s taking place, but it will usually require your Redis instance to be offline for only a
few minutes. If you don’t specify a window, one will be selected randomly.

-> **IMPORTANT!**
It is not possible to delete a maintenance window, so the resource will just be removed from state upon deletion.

## Example Usage

```hcl-terraform
resource "herokux_redis_maintenance_window" "foobar" {
	redis_id = "717e9e8f-c4ad-4f45-9ac3-069ecb0fcd60"
	window = "Mondays 10:30"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `redis_id` - (Required) `<string>` The UUID of a Heroku redis instance.

* `window` - (Required) `<string>` The day-of-week and time (UTC) at which the window begins.
For example: `Sundays 10:30`. Note: the `s` attached to the word `Sunday` is required.

## Import

An existing maintenance window can be imported using the redis ID.

For example:

```shell script
$ terraform import herokux_redis_maintenance_window.foobar "717e9e8f-c4ad-4f45-9ac3-069ecb0fcd60"
```
